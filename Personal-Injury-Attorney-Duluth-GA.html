<p>Anyone who is injured due to the negligence of another person or entity is entitled to the best legal representation possible and fair and full compensation. Those who are faced with the most serious and catastrophic injuries may suffer life-long injuries that will require assistance to survive. Finding appropriate and adequate legal representation is crucial to support and care for these seriously injured victims.&nbsp; These types of injuries can change the victims life forever which in turn can affect the families who love and depended on them for everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/okAGMtJqSoU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  In legal terms, a serious injury is a personal injury&nbsp; &ldquo;which results in death; dismemberment; significant disfigurement; a fracture; loss of a fetus; permanent loss of use of a body organ, member, function, or system; permanent consequential limitation of use of a body organ or member; significant limitation of use of a body function or system; or a medically determined injury or impairment of a non-permanent nature which prevents the injured person from performing substantially all of the material acts which constitutes their usual and customary daily activities for no less than 90 days during the 180 days immediately following the injury or impairment.&rdquo; Serious injury claims are often coupled with additional claims from auto, truck, motorcycle, or premises liability accidents.<br>

<p>In addition to the immediate needs of medical bills and income replacement, there are often ancillary needs concerning the individual&rsquo;s pain and suffering, trauma, and more that need to be addressed as they learn to navigate life going forward. The extensive medical bills after your injury may make you inclined to settle, but this should be avoided. The party who is at-fault for the accident may attempt to undercompensate you. This is unacceptable and you deserve a personal injury lawyer who will support you as you navigate this process.<br>
  </p>
<p>The team at Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. is not only experienced handling these cases, but our caring and compassionate lawyers are with you every step of the way. From the first consultation meeting through trial (should your claim require it), our lawyers believe that each of our clients deserves the utmost respect and fair representation as they pursue their claim.</p>
<h3>What Types of Accidents Are Considered Serious Injury Cases in Duluth GA&nbsp;</h3>
<p>While many serious injury claims are often the result of other personal injury accidents, including car or motorcycle accidents, train accidents, or premises liability, serious injury claims tend to have longer-lasting effects and impact on the individual&rsquo;s life and wellbeing, and, as such, need to be handled appropriately.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Serious injury cases can include the following conditions, along with many others</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Herniated/bulging disks</li>
  <li>Neck and head injuries</li>
  <li>Mental impairment</li>
  <li>Loss of consortium</li>
  <li>Miscarriage/pregnancy      loss&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Brain injuries</li>
  <li>Catastrophic injuries</li>

  <li>Burns</li>
  <li>Internal bleeding and      lacerations</li>

  <li>Nerve damage</li>
  <li>Permanent scarring and      disfigurement</li>
</ul>
<h4>Determining Negligence and Liability in a Serious Injury in Georgia&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In a serious injury case, there is often one individual, or even several individuals, who are liable for the accident and had they made different decisions, they could have avoided the accident entirely. In most instances, an attorney is best suited to determine which individual(s) and entities have contributed to risk, negligence, and liability in a serious injury case.<br>
  </p>
<p>The legal proof point, as it relates to serious injuries, considers something that is known as the &ldquo;reasonable person standard.&rdquo; This standard evaluates the way in which most reasonable individuals would be likely to behave in a particular situation under similar or the same circumstances. As citizens, we operate under a standard of care knowing that our behaviors impact those around us.&nbsp;<br>
  </p>
<p>This action and standard are known legally as &ldquo;due care.&rdquo; One example that many people can relate to is abiding by traffic laws and speed limits. While most people take due care and abide by all posted speed limits, individuals who do not follow these laws are not taking due care. Should they cause an accident as a result of their speeding and someone is seriously injured in that automotive accident, they have violated the reasonable person standard and are typically held liable in the eyes of the law.&nbsp; If you or someone you love has been injured in an accident that was a result of the careless, reckless, or negligent actions of another person or business, you may be entitled to compensation for your injuries and losses.

Nugent, P.C. today to discuss your legal options.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>When Should I Call A Duluth Georgia Lawyer After My Serious Injury Accident?</h4>
<p>Because of the long-lasting impact of serious injuries and the complexity of the financial implications that follow a serious injury accident getting legal guidance as quickly as possible can be crucial in your personal injury lawsuit. People who have been critically injured in an accident need to focus on their recovery for an extended period of time, if not for the rest of their lives.&nbsp; Injured victims need to be focused on healing and therefore are unable to do anything but struggle to get through each day.&nbsp;<br>
  Unfortunately, the strict requirements of a statute of limitations – the legal time limit by which you are able to file a claim – are working against you. Your statue of limitations begins the moment your accident takes place, even as you are just beginning to understand the extent of your injuries and its lasting impact on your health and your finances.&nbsp;<br>
  </p>
<p>In Duluth GA, the laws are written with the protection of the injured individual in mind. These legal parameters aim to compensate you completely for your economic losses – including medical bills, rehabilitation, medical equipment, and more – as well as the pain and suffering you have endured and will potentially endure in the future.&nbsp;<br>
  </p>
<p>Understanding an accident&rsquo;s impact on your future earnings, factoring in anticipated medical expenses, and practically addressing the likelihood of future pain are all challenging factors to address and it is advisable to work with an experienced legal representative.<br>
  </p>
<p>In some instances, your injury may impact your ability to earn a living or contribute to retirement. All of this should be factored into your compensation as well. Other factors include your age, income, career trajectory, the egregiousness of the negligence that caused your injury, and much more.<br>
