It is important to let the at-fault party know of the incident so that they can create a record.

<p>Since the insurance company for the at-fault party will be fighting hard to prove that their client was not negligent, you need to collect proof and documentation proving that indeed the at-fault party was negligent. On contacting our lawyers, we will advise you all the documentation and information you need to formulate a formidable claim case. </p>
<p>Some of the documents that can help bolster your case include:</p>
<p>•	Videos or photos of the scene of the slip and fall accident (It is best that you take photos and videos of the accident scene as soon as it happens)<br>
  •	A comprehensive analysis of the injuries you sustained from your doctor<br>
  •	Statements from other people who may have witnessed how the accident happened<br>
  •	Medical bills for treatment that you have received so far<br>
  •	An affidavit from your doctor detailing any treatment costs that may arise in the future<br>
  •	Work records showing any time that you missed from your job because of the injuries as a result of the slip and fall accident<br>
  •	Any evidence showing that the at-fault party has a habit of negligent actions that expose other people to the risk of harm</p>

<h2>What Will Happen When I File a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/personalinjuryattorneysawq7d">Savannah Personal Injury Claim</a>?</h2>
<p>Once we have collected enough evidence and crafted a strong claim case, our attorneys will go ahead and file the case in the appropriate court. This will then give the at-fault party and their representatives time to formulate a reply to the claim case. On filing a claim case, you can expect that the at-fault party to respond in the following manner:</p>
<p>•	They will say that they are not responsible for causing your accident <br>
  •	They may accept responsibility for the accident but offer you a compensation pay out that is way less than what you actually deserve </p>

We will however shrewdly negotiate with the insurance company for the at-fault party and get you compensation that is at par with the level of injuries and losses you suffered after the accident.</p>
