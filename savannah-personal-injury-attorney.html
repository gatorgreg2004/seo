<h1>Personal Injury Lawyers in Savannah Georgia</h1>
<p>An injury accident in Savannah can turn your world upside down. You may be left facing large out-of-pocket costs from extensive medical treatments following the accident. You will also receive calls from an insurance adjuster working on behalf of the at-fault party. The adjuster will make you a settlement offer which, according to them, will compensate you for your injuries. Many people make the mistake of quickly accepting the offer without first speaking to an experienced Savannah personal injury attorney in Georgia. </p>

<p>It is important to remember that the insurance company is not on your side. The adjuster is hoping to settle your claims quickly and on their terms, thus saving the insurance company a lot of money. If you accept an early settlement, you may be undervaluing the claim. Once you accept an offer and sign a release, you no longer have any ability to bring suit against the negligent party responsible for your accident. Our Savannah personal injury attorneys at <a href="https://www.attorneykennugent.com/our-team/about-ken-nugent/">Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C.</a> will not let you settle for less than you deserve.
  
  Our lawyers will look at all angles of your case, including the nature of injuries that you have suffered, the cost of your past and future medical treatment, and the impact that the accident has had on your life. Using our experience and the assistance of experts, we will properly value your claim and enter into settlement negotiations, with the upper hand, against the insurance company.
  
  If you have suffered an injury due to the negligence of another party, our Savannah injury attorneys stand ready to fight for you. We will ensure that you receive the compensation you deserve. Give us a call now at 888-579-1890.

<h2><b><a href="https://www.attorneykennugent.com/personal-injury/savannah/">Savannah Personal Injury Attorney</a></b>
</h2>
<p>Georgia injury laws allow an injured victim to bring a claim in a variety of circumstances. Each type of claim is different and must be handled by a skilled and experienced attorney who is well-versed in the law. At Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C., our Savannah injury accident lawyers bring over 350 years of combined experience for your benefit. The types of cases that we handle include: </p>
<p><b>Automobile Accidents </b>  </p>
<p>Driving in Georgia can be a dangerous activity. In 2016, our state saw 1,554 fatalities in traffic crashes. Over 300 of these fatal crashes were caused by impaired drivers.
  
  Trucking accidents, including 18-wheeler crashes, can cause devastating injuries to victims. If you have suffered injuries in a crash involving a commercial vehicle, it is important to speak with our Savannah truck accident attorneys right away to ensure that your valuable legal rights are protected.
  
  A Georgia car crash can also involve pedestrians. Pedestrians are vulnerable to injuries when they are involved in an accident with a vehicle, including brain and spinal cord injuries, as well as fractures and broken bones.</p>
<p><b>Bicycle Accidents</b>
</p>
<p>Bicycle accidents can result from driver error or other conditions, such as poorly-maintained roadways or dangerous intersections. A bicycle accident can cause the following injuries: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Road rash</li>
 	<li>Spinal cord injuries</li>
 	<li>Head injuries</li>
 	<li>Neck trauma, including paralysis</li>
 	<li>Broken bones</li>
 	<li>Cuts and bruises</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the serious nature of bicycle accidents, you must protect your legal rights immediately following the crash. </p>
<p><b>Slip-and-Fall Accidents</b>
</p>
<p>Property owners have a duty to keep their premises in a safe condition for visitors. A slip-and-fall is a common accident that occurs in retail stores and other business establishments. Wet floors and poorly maintained structures, such as decks, balconies and patios, can all result in a slip-and-fall injury. In these cases, you may be able to hold the business owner responsible for their negligence in failing to maintain the property in a safe manner. Call our Savannah slip-and-fall attorneys today to discuss your claim for free.
</p>
<p><b>Workplace Accidents</b></p>
<p>
  
<img class="alignleft " src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1lCGVmAc8WnO1KneayEnntzkGEJ_ae6Jo" alt="Savannah Personal Injury Attorney" width="423" height="475" /></p>
<p>Georgia’s workplace laws are complicated. When you have been hurt on the job you may have the right to file a worker’s compensation claim to recover money for your medical treatment and any permanent disability arising from the claim. In certain situations, however, you may be able to avoid worker’s compensation law and seek damages directly from the third party that caused your injuries. When your injuries are caused by the negligence of someone other than your employer, you could file a personal injury claim outside of the traditional worker’s compensation laws.
  
  To discuss your case, please contact one of our Savannah workplace accident attorneys today to setup your free consultation.
</p>
<p><b>Defective Products</b>
</p>
<p>When you purchase a new product, the last thing you expect is a serious injury. However, a product defect can result in the possibility of catastrophic injury or even death. Some examples include malfunctioning brakes on your car or a piece of furniture that has an error in its design. When a consumer is hurt by a defective product, they may be entitled to certain types of compensation.
  
Our Savannah products liability attorneys will ensure that the appropriate individuals are held responsible for your injuries. Contact us today to discuss how to move forward when you have been hurt due to the negligence of a product manufacturer. </p>
<p><b>Medical Malpractice</b>
</p>
<p>Medical malpractice cases present some of the most complicated legal claims. A doctor, hospital, or medical provider has a duty to provide appropriate care to all patients. When medical care falls short of established standards, victims have the right to file a malpractice claim against their medical provider.
  
  There are very strict legal requirements for asserting a medical malpractice claim. Your claim must be filed within a specified period of time after the incident occurred. Your lawsuit must also have an accompanying affidavit from a professional witness certifying that, in their opinion, you received substandard care.
  
  Our Savannah medical malpractice attorneys can help when you or a loved one suffered injuries as a result of improper medical care.</p>
<p><b>Dog Bites</b></p>
<p>It may be difficult to imagine yourself being a victim of a dog bite injury. Georgia dog bite laws follow a negligence model, meaning that the owner of a vicious or dangerous dog will be held responsible if their negligence led to your injuries. Proving negligence in a Georgia dog bite claim is not always easy as the dog owner will likely defend their own actions.
  
  If you or a family member were injured as a result of a dog bite, you should immediately contact our Savannah dog bite attorneys for advice on how to proceed. We will ensure that you do not jeopardize your claim to compensation.</p>
<p> <b>Nursing Home Abuse</b></p>
<p>
  
  Elder abuse is, unfortunately, a common occurrence both in Georgia and nationwide. Current statistics from the National Council on Aging show that one in 10 Americans over the age of 60 have experienced some form of elder abuse, with up to five million elder abuse cases reported each year.
  
  Nursing home neglect is a form of elder abuse. Some types of elder abuse that occurs in nursing homes are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Physical attacks, such as assault and battery</li>
 	<li>Sexual abuse</li>
 	<li>Deprivation of food and water</li>
 	<li>Improper administration of medication</li>
 	<li>Improper care resulting in injuries, such as bedsores or falls</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;
  
  A complete investigation is required in cases where nursing home neglect is suspected. At Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C., our Georgia elder abuse attorneys will not back down when your loved one has suffered at the hands of a caregiver. Give us a call today to discuss your case. 1-800-CALL-KEN
  
</p>
<p><b>Construction Accidents</b>
  
</p>
<p>Construction accidents cause some of the most devastating workplace injuries that we see. The construction industry is among the most-deadly industries, both in Georgia and throughout the United States.
  
  A construction accident can leave you suffering from serious and debilitating injuries, including permanent disability. Finding the negligent party and holding them responsible requires the services of a trusted and skilled attorney.
  
Our Savannah construction accident attorneys bring over 350 years of combined experience to each case. We will help ensure that you receive appropriate compensation if you or a loved one were hurt due to a construction site accident. </p>
<p><b>Premises Liability</b></p>
<p>
  
  Premises liability laws are in place to keep visitors safe. Property owners have a duty to ensure that their premises are safe for all lawful visitors or guests. When an invited visitor or guest sustains injuries on a property, the property owner may be legally responsible for the injuries. In cases where the owner has failed to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition, an injured victim may recover damages for any injuries that they have suffered.
  
  Our Savannah premises liability lawyers are standing by now to speak with you about your claim.
  
</p>
