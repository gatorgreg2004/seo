<h1>Do You Have A Valid <a href="https://hopeless-rom4ntic.tumblr.com/post/615659567013101568/savannah-legal-team-for-injuries" title="Personal Injury Lawyers Savannah GA">Savannah Personal Injury</a> Car Accident Claim? </h1>
<p>Following a car accident, there are many things that you should do. One of these things is to contact a personal injury lawyer as soon as you can. Just because accidents happen on a daily basis doesn't mean you don't have a claim. From a legal standpoint, most accidents are preventable and only occur because of negligent behavior. Discussing your accident with an experienced lawyer can help you decide if you have a valid claim because of potential negligence. </p>
<h2>Our office has experience making claims with the following types of accidents in Savannah: </h2>
<ul>
  <li>DUI</li>
  <li>Accidents that cause whiplash</li>
  <li>Distracted driving</li>
  <li>Defective tires</li>
  <li>Driving in hazardous conditions, including rain and fog</li>
  <li>T-bone accidents</li>
  <li>Head-on collisions</li>
  <li>Rear-end auto accidents</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, getting into an accident with a driver that does not have insurance or a driver that has fled the scene can cause a lot of unsure feelings. However, the validity of your claim is not dependent upon the other driver's insurance. Our lawyers may find you are eligible for compensation regardless of the other driver. </p>

<h3>Will my claim result in a Savannah court case? </h3>
<p>There is not usually a reason to go to court in auto accident claim courses. However, there may be times that going to court can be beneficial. If the insurance company is unwilling to provide a fair settlement, local courts are a smart option. There is no need to worry as we will provide you with information as to the negotiation process and where you stand. If things stall, our lawyers will provide advice as to what they think the next steps should be. The choice to take the case to court is yours. Regardless of the choice you make, our team can take care of it all. </p>
<p>Typically, we are able to work with the insurance company to resolve our cases. The process isn't an easy one, but our lawyers take the time to properly investigate each case. This allows us to gain police reports, expert medical opinions, and witness statements to provide as strong arguments. Then, we show the insurance company our case and they realize that with our evidence, we could easily win at trial. This leads them to offering more money. </p>
